# DSI Assignment Task 1
 
# In this task I created 5 java classes - Main, Balance, Product, ProductList and Shop.
# Product class contains behaviors of the product like it's name, buying price, selling price, available number in the intentory e.t.c. It also contains functions that are used for accessing these attributes and update their value.
# ProductList class is used to contain the number of products that are added, deleted, sold or bought. It contains the total product list.
# Balance is used to keep track of the total balance after operations are performed.
# Shop class is the main controller. From shop, we invoke functions that are inside the ProductList class and perform operations.
# Inside Main class, I created a new Shop. And then Shop handled all the operations.
